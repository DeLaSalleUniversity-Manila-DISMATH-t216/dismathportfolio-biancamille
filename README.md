# My DISMATH Portfolio
dismathportfolio-biancamille created by Classroom for GitHub

## Week 1:
- From our orientation, I learned that the topics to be discussed are not easy.
- I learned that I need to study hard on this subject to pass, even though I have lots of major subjects this term.
- I learned what **Proposition** means and how you could tell that the statement is a proposition or not.
- I learned that this subject deals with **Mathematical Truth**.
- I learned the symbols in logical connectives and the way how to prove it using the truth table.
- I did an advanced reading on "Logical Equivalences and Proof by Truth Table", so I learned the different logical equivalences to use in proving.
- I read the "Rules of Interference" and I got so confused but I already have an idea how it works so maybe I'll just wait for the time that this will be discussed.
- I tried to answer the drills and I find it interesting because it challenges my brain to work.
