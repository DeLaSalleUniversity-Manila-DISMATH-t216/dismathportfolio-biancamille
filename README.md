# My DISMATH Portfolio
dismathportfolio-biancamille created by Classroom for GitHub

## Week 1:
- From our orientation, I learned that the topics to be discussed are not easy.
- I learned that I need to study hard on this subject to pass, even though I have lots of major subjects this term.
- I learned what **Proposition** means and how you could tell that the statement is a proposition or not.
- I learned that this subject deals with **Mathematical Truth**.
- I learned the symbols in logical connectives and the way how to prove it using the truth table.

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Formula | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0  | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |

- I did an advanced reading on "Logical Equivalences and Proof by Truth Table", so I learned the different logical equivalences to use in proving.
- I read the "Rules of Interference" and I got so confused but I already have an idea how it works so maybe I'll just wait for the time that this will be discussed.
- I tried to answer the drills and I find it interesting because it challenges my brain to work.

## Week 2:
- I learned that the Truth Table for Biconditional  is just the negation of Exclusive OR (XOR).

TRUTH TABLE FOR BICONDITIONAL

| p | q | p ↔ q |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

TRUTH TABLE FOR NEGATION OF EXCLUSIVE OR

| p | q | p ⊕ q | ¬ ( p ⊕ q )|
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

- I learned the proper way of proving certain problem that only uses Logical Equivalences, by identifying what law was applied per step.
